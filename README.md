# FireSaaS Project

![FireSaaS](./public/firesaas.png)

## **Overview**

FireSaaS is an integrated SaaS (Software as a Service) solution that leverages Firebase, Stripe, and other technologies to create a seamless and scalable platform for SaaS businesses. This project encapsulates key functionalities like user authentication, subscription management, and payment processing, making it easier for developers to build and manage SaaS applications.

## **Key Features**

- **Firebase Integration**: Utilizes Firebase for backend services including authentication and database management.
- **Stripe for Payments**: Integrates Stripe for handling subscriptions and payments.
- **Security**: Implements Firestore security rules for data protection.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed for easy customization and scalability to suit various SaaS requirements.

## **Why did I build this?**

I built this because so many people that make SaaS templates charge a lot of money for them, and the ones that exist don't use technologies that I like (I enjoy Firebase quite a bit.)

I also have a goal to make a lot of small SaaS apps this year, so this is fulfilling a personal need of being tired of implementing Stripe and Firebase over and over again.

## **Getting Started**
