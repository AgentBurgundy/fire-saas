          <p>
            I personally fell in love with Firebase and have been using it for
            around 4 years. I like the NoSQL db, I like the GCP environment and
            feel comfortable in it. However, there's lots of other options and I
            may port this library to support those other platforms in the
            future.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It doesn't mean it's the best for everyone, but if you want to
            prototype fast, Firebase is the way to go IMO.

        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            It's the bog-standard payment processor when it comes to building
            SaaS apps. However I do understand there are some great alternatives
            on the market. In the future I may port this repo to support other
            processors as well!

        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Mixpanel is a great application for tracking user behavior and user
            click events. The free plan is pretty generous too and I've been
            using it for years.

          <p>
            I actually just started picking up DaisyUI, it's pretty cool and I
            like a lot of the default styles so I said eff it, let's start
            building with it.

            Swapping out component libraries is pretty easy though, and I may
            even build out alternative repos using things like NextUI or{" "}
            {"<pick-your-component-library-poison-here>"}

          Why should I use this?

        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            If you don't like building apps with NextJS and Firebase, you
            probably shouldn't.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            I'm really just solving my own problem here, but if you're like me
            and love NextJS, and you love Firebase, and you want to spin up apps
            faster... then this is for you.
